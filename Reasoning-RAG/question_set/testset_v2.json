    "question": "How to Align the Origin on a Genmitsu 3020-PRO MAX CNC (Including Tool Length Compensation and XY Work Offset)",
    "answer": "To align the origin, set the Work Coordinate Origin (0,0,0), which is different from the machine’s Home. First, power on the CNC and jog the toolhead so the bit is at your desired XY starting point, then use your software or controller to set XY to zero. Next, zero the Z-axis: use a scrap paper to detect contact manually or a Z-probe for automatic detection. During tool changes or multiple operations, only the Z-axis needs to be re-zeroed the XY origin remains the same.",
    "LLM": "To align the origin on a Genmitsu 3020-PRO MAX CNC, the following steps are involved, based on the provided context, which focuses primarily on the Genmitsu 3018 and 3018 Pro/PROVer models, but the principles are applicable:\n\n1.  **Finding the Work Coordinate Origin:** The origin is where X, Y, and Z are all equal to zero. The origin's location depends on the project; common locations are the center of the project or the bottom-left corner of the workspace. The origin is visually represented by a specific image (not detailed in the context).\n\n2.  **Navigating to the Work Coordinate Origin (X and Y axes):** Using the jog controls in software like Candle, navigate the X and Y axes to bring the tip of the engraving bit to the desired work coordinate origin. Ignore the Z axis for this step. For a 3018 PROVer CNC, homing the CNC is required before jogging any axis.\n\n3.  **Zeroing the X and Y Axes:** Once the engraving bit is positioned at the desired X and Y origin, press the designated key (unspecified, but likely a \"zero\" button in the software) to zero out the X and Y axes. This will set the work coordinates for X and Y to 0.\n\n4.  **Zeroing the Z Axis (Tool Length Compensation):** There are two methods for zeroing the Z axis:\n\n    * **Without a Z-Probe:** Use a thin piece of scrap paper. Bring the end mill close to, but not touching, the stock material. Set the jog step size to \".1\". Place the paper between the end mill and the stock, and move the paper back and forth while lowering the Z axis until the paper snags against the end mill. Refine the position by reducing the step size to \".01\" for finer adjustments. Once satisfied, select the button to zero out the Z axis.\n\n    * **With a Z-Probe (PROver or modified 3018 Pro):** Set up the Z probe and place it between the end mill and the stock material. Press the designated button to zero the Z axis.\n\n5.  **Work Coordinate System and Finishing Pass:** The CNC remembers the new (0,0) origin until a new one is set or the machine is powered off. This allows for changing end mills for different operations. After changing the end mill, zero-out the Z-axis again before starting the finishing pass.\n\n**XY Work Offset:** The work coordinate system allows you to define (0,0) at any location on your stock material. Moving the end mill from the home position to the bottom left corner of the stock material and zeroing the X and Y axes establishes a new origin. The coordinate map changes to reflect this offset.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n\nThe context does not provide specific details on:\n\n* How to perform a \"homing cycle\" on the 3020-PRO MAX.\n* The specific software interface for the 3020-PRO MAX (e.g., a visual representation of the \"zero\" button).\n* The exact procedure for setting up the Z-probe, beyond mentioning its use.\n* Detailed instructions on how to account for tool length compensation beyond re-zeroing the Z axis after a tool change.\n* Specific G-code commands or parameters related to work offsets.\n* How to connect the Z-Probe to the 3018-PRO (only mentions the pin marked A5)."

    "question": "Should I Adjust the Feed Rate or Spindle Speed?",
    "answer": "While feed rate and spindle speed are important parameters in CNC machining, the provided sources lack specific guidance on how to adjust them effectively. Issues like undefined feed rate (Error Code 22), spindle behavior, and incorrect engraving sizes are mentioned, but solutions focus more on spindle control and machine settings than optimal speed/feed tuning. Proper adjustment based on material and tool is crucial, but further guidance is needed beyond what's currently documented.",
    "LLM": "Based on the provided documents, the user is experiencing an issue where the CNC router stops during operation, even after slowing down the spindle speed (S200) and feed rate (F100). The context suggests several troubleshooting steps, but doesn't directly say whether feed rate or spindle speed should be adjusted to solve the original problem.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potentially relevant factors and troubleshooting steps mentioned in the context:\n\n1.  **Spindle Functionality:** The documents suggest verifying the spindle motor's basic functionality. This includes checking if the spindle motor turns on and off properly using the control button and if the spindle speed can be controlled using the slider. If the spindle speed can be controlled normally, it indicates that the spindle motor itself might not have any problems.\n\n2.  **G-code Issues:** The context mentions that incorrect G-code can cause issues. Specifically, the use of G28 commands, which instruct the router to go to a \"safe\" position, can sometimes cause the bit to plunge into the work material due to the limitations of small routers. It's suggested to either tell the CAM software not to use G28 commands or to delete them from the G-code. The user should also test with a sample gcode.\n\n3.  **Wiring and Connections:** The document mentions checking the wiring of the spindle motor. If the spindle motor is rotating in the wrong direction, the wires on top of the motor should be swapped. For newer motors, there might be a faint \"+\" mark indicating the correct polarity. The red wire should be connected to the connector closest to the red dot or \"+\" mark.\n\n4.  **Power Supply:** A faulty power supply can cause the spindle to pulse on and off. This is due to the high current draw during spindle startup, which triggers the overload protection of the power supply.\n\n5.  **Units Mismatch:** Incorrect engraving size can be caused by a mismatch of units (Inches and mm) between the router and the design/manufacture software. Also, incorrect router settings of $100 to $102 can cause this.\n\n6.  **Mechanical Issues:** The X-axis linear bearings might be binding, causing the machine to catch and jump. The alignment of the guide rods and threaded screw should be checked.\n\n7.  **Bit Installation:** The collet should only be touching the full cylindrical shaft portion of the bit. No flat or cutting edges should be inside of the collet. Also, the exposed length of the bit should be considered to avoid spindle collisions with the stock material.\n\n8.  **Work Coordinate System and Z-Axis Zeroing:** The context describes how to set the work coordinate origin and zero the Z-axis using either a piece of paper or a Z-probe. This is important for ensuring accurate cuts.\n\nThe documents do not provide enough information to definitively say whether feed rate or spindle speed should be adjusted. The documents suggest slowing down the spindle speed, but also mention that the spindle motor may have issues. A systematic approach of checking each of the above potential problems is needed."

    "question": "After Inspection, the Tolerance Is Off. What Should I Do?",
    "answer": "Start by confirming both your CAM software and CNC are using the same unit system (inches or millimeters). Then, check your machine’s $100–$102 settings to ensure correct steps/mm for all axes. Also, verify that the origin is correctly aligned and zeroed on the stock material. These steps will help ensure dimensional accuracy and correct any tolerance issues during cutting.",
    "LLM": "The 'Tolerance Is Off', indicating that the engraving size is wrong. The possible solutions, according to the provided documents, involve checking and correcting unit mismatches and router settings.\n\n1.  **Unit Mismatch**: A mismatch between the units used in the design and manufacturing software and the router can cause the engraving size to be wrong. Ensure that the units are the same (either inches or mm) across all software and router settings.\n\n2.  **Incorrect Router Settings ($100 to $102)**: The router settings $100 to $102 might be incorrect or have been modified. These settings should have the same value, either 800 or 1600, depending on the router motherboard.\n\nThe documents do not provide further information on how to adjust these settings or troubleshoot beyond these two points."

    "question": "There Is Visible Tool Chatter and Vibration. What Should I Do?",
    "answer": "Begin by checking mechanical alignment ensure the guide rods and lead screws are aligned and couplers are secure. Loosen and retighten the guide rod screws while manually moving the spindle end-to-end to smoothen axis travel. Lubricate lead screws and rails regularly to reduce resistance and noise. Although adjusting feed rate and spindle speed may help, mechanical checks are the primary recommendation based on the documented causes.",
    "LLM": "TThe visible tool chatter and vibration could stem from several issues related to the CNC router's mechanical components, software configuration, or operational parameters.\n\n**1. Mechanical Issues and Alignment:**\n\n* **Axis Binding:** The X-axis linear bearings might be binding, causing the machine to catch and jump. This can be due to misalignment of the guide rods and the threaded screw that moves the axis. Also, check the coupler between the stepper motor and the X-axis threaded screw to ensure correct alignment and tightness. Loosen the screws holding the guide rods, move the spindle mount all the way to the left by turning the threaded screw by hand and tighten the left-hand screws, move the spindle mount to the right in the same way and tighten the right-hand screws to improve movement across the axis.\n* **Lubrication:** Lack of lubrication on the lead screws and guide rails for each axis can increase running noise. Lubricating these components can reduce noise and extend the lifespan of the CNC.\n* **Spindle Installation:** Ensure the spindle is correctly installed in the spindle motor holder and that the M5 Hex screws are tightened.\n* **Workholding:** Ensure the stock material is firmly secured to the CNC bed using clamps. The work area should be clear of clamps to avoid collisions during engraving.\n\n**2. Spindle and Bit Issues:**\n\n* **Spindle Speed:** If the spindle speed is too low, the machine may stop. If slowing the spindle speed to S200 and the F100 values causes the machine to stop, it indicates a potential issue with the spindle motor itself.\n* **Bit Installation:** The collet should only be touching the full cylindrical shaft portion of the bit. No flat or cutting edges should be inside of the collet. Ensure the spindle cap is firmly tightened using two spanners/wrenches, one to hold the spindle in place and the other to tighten the cap.\n\n**3. Software and Configuration:**\n\n* **Laser Mode:** If using a laser, ensure the Grbl motherboard is set to laser mode by sending a `$32=1` command from the console pane. When replacing the spindle motor, send a `$32=0` command.\n* **Gcode and Safe Position:** The Gcode might be commanding the router to an unsafe position, causing the bit to plunge into the work. This is often due to a G28 command. It's preferable to tell your CAM software not to use G28 commands, or delete them from the Gcode.\n* **Units Mismatch:** Check that the units used on the router and in the design and manufacturing software are the same (Inches vs. mm). A mismatch can cause incorrect engraving sizes.\n* **Router Settings:** The router settings of `$100` to `$102` might be incorrect or modified. These should all have the same value (800 or 1600, depending on the motherboard).\n\n**4. Power Supply:**\n\n* **Spindle Pulsing:** If the spindle pulses on and off, it may be caused by a faulty power supply. The current used by the spindle starting is high and it triggers the overload protection of the power supply.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n\nThe provided context does not include specific details about:\n\n* The type of material being cut.\n* The specific cutting parameters (feed rate, depth of cut).\n* The specific Gcode being used.\n* The specific CNC model (beyond Genmitsu 3018 or 3020 PRO).\n\nTherefore, a more targeted diagnosis would require additional information about these parameters."
