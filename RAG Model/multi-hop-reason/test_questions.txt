What are the thermodynamic and kinetic considerations when synthesizing carbon nanotubes using fluidized bed chemical vapor deposition (CVD)?
How do different functionalization methods (e.g., amine vs. carboxyl) compare in modifying carbon nanotube properties for specific applications?
What role does the diameter and chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) play in their electronic and optical properties?
